IN PROGRESS! DOESN'T WORK YET!

A sample OpenID consumer app for Google App Engine. Allows users to log into
other OpenID providers, then stores their OpenID login.

Part of http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-samples/.

For more about OpenID, see:

Uses JanRain's Python OpenID library, version 2.1.1, licensed under the 
Apache Software License 2.0:

The JanRain library includes a reference OpenID provider that can be used to
test this consumer. After starting the dev_appserver with this app, unpack the
JanRain library and run these commands from its root directory:

  setenv PYTHONPATH .
  python ./examples/server.py -s localhost

Then go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser, type in
http://localhost:8000/test as your OpenID identifier, and click Verify.
